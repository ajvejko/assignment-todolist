# Description

The goal is to create a To-Do app using Vue and the state management library Vuex.

## Requirements - what should it be able to do

- create new To-Do lists
- create new To-Dos
- edit To-Do
- mark To-Do as finished
- delete To-Do
- filter To-Dos by their name, globally across multiple To-Do lists

## Aditional features - something that would be nice, but is not required

- store the To-Dos in localStorage
- drag & drop to reorder To-Dos
- drag & drop to move To-Do item between To-Do lists
